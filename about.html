				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I have always had an analytical and creative mind.  My first programming class was in Junior High.  It was on an IBM PET computer.  I recall one of the big achievements of that course was making an ASCII rocket "launch" off the screen.  In highschool I recall my programing teacher making a big deal about High Res graphics! In highschool I enjoyed my art and psychology courses, but was not aware of a career that would allow me to combined them. In college I learned about the field of Human Factors. I liked the idea of using psychology to improve the design of machines. </p>
				<p>With that goal in mind I studied Cognitive Psychology at the University of Utah. I studied with Dr. David Strayer, who is best known for his work on the negative impacts of texting and driving. He is also the person who told me of this cool application called Mosaic. At the University of Illinois I studied  Aviation Psychology with Chris Wickens, Gavin Lintern, and Nadine Sarter, however with the web really starting to take off I decided to switch to Indiana Universities Information Science program to study HCI with Andy Dillon.</p>
				<p>I have an interest in virtual reality, so Andy Dillon introduced me to Information in Place, Inc. where I worked on mobile, location based applications, and augmented reality. I worked on a variety of applications for various government agencies. I enjoyed the work, but augmented reality was a niche field on the bleeding edge, and as with many start ups, funding can be sporadic, so I decided to try other companies. Since leaving IIPI I have worked with a variety of jobs for companies such as Nationwide Insurance, Microsoft, Boeing, and AT&amp;T. While at these jobs I have worked as a UX Researcher, Interaction Designer, and most recently as a Product Owner.</p>
